        - Added new Mojo::Client, because the old one had bugs that prevented
          proper scaling and could not be fixed otherwise.
          Note that this change is not backwards compatible, the decision to
          make it so close to the 1.0 release was not easy but the bugs were
          simply too serious.
        - Added native JSON support.
        - Added more designer friendly .ep templates to Mojolicious.
          The default template format for your application can be controlled
          with the default_handler attribute of the mojolicious renderer.
              Mojolicious (in the startup method):
                  $self->renderer->default_handler('epl');
                  $self->renderer->default_handler('ep');
	          Mojolicious::Lite:
	              app->renderer->default_handler('epl');
	              app->renderer->default_handler('ep');
        - Added helper support for .ep templates.
        - Added callback tests. (melo)
        - Added support for MOJO_CHUNK_SIZE=1. (melo)
        - Added not_found.html.* templates.
        - Added input streaming support to Mojo::Content.
        - Added client, param, pause, redirect_to and resume to
          Mojolicious::Controller.
        - Renamed Mojo::Manual to Mojolicious::Book.
        - Updated Mojolicious lite_app generator to use .ep templates.
        - Fixed many bugs in the HTTP 1.1 state machine and added the ability
          to pause transactions.
        - Fixed param to be CGI.pm compatible.
        - Fixed a few cases where exceptions and not found events would
          result in empty pages.
        - Fixed layouts with partial templates.
        - Fixed encoding of non utf8 form data.
        - Fixed body callbacks to get automatic buffering.
        - Fixed a case where Mojo::Server::Daemon and Mojo::Client were too
          defensive and made them in turn 20 times faster.
        - Fixed keep alive problem in Mojo::Transaction::Pipeline.
        - Fixed and simplified Mojo::Parameters. (gbarr)
        - Fixed xml_escape to use character semantics. (vti)
        - Fixed utf8 handling of routes captures. (vti)

        - Fixed undefined value in If-Modified-Since check in
          MojoX::Dispatcher::Routes.
        - Fixed MojoX::Routes::Pattern::match. (trendels)

0.991250 2009-08-18 00:00:00
        - This release contains many substantial changes that are not
          backwards compatible, but good news is that it's also the last
          major feature breaking release before 1.0. ;)
          Older releases of Mojo did contain additional Mojo::Script::* and
          Mojolicious::Script::* modules that are obsolete now and might
          break this version if they are still present on your system.
          Because of this we highly suggest that you
          DELETE ALL MODULES IN THE "Mojo", "MojoX" AND "Mojolicious"
          NAMESPACES MANUALLY!!!
        - Mojo::Script has been renamed to Mojo::Command, this change is not
          backwards compatible!
          You will have to regenerate application scripts or replace
          "Mojo(licious)::Script" with "Mojo(licious)::Command" manually.
        - Removed unused features from Mojo::Base and simplified API, this
          change is not backwards compatible!
              __PACKAGE__->attr('foo', default => 'bar');
          becomes
              __PACKAGE__->attr(foo => 'bar');
        - Merged eplite and epl, this change is not backwards compatible, you
          will have to rename all your eplite templates to epl.
        - Simplified MojoX::Renderer, this change is not backwards
          compatible!
          Handler can no longer be detected, that means "default_handler" or
          the "handler" argument are required.
          The template argument can no longer contain format or handler.
              $self->render(template => 'foo.html.epl')
          becomes
              $self->render('foo', format => 'html', handler => 'epl')
          The following forms are available now.
              $self->render;
              $self->render(controller => 'foo', action => 'bar');
              $self->render({controller => 'foo', action => 'bar'});
              $self->render(text => 'Hello!');
              $self->render(template => 'index');
              $self->render(template => 'foo/index');
              $self->render(
                  template => 'index',
                  format   => 'html',
                  handler  => 'epl'
              );
              $self->render(handler => 'something');
              $self->render('foo/bar');
              $self->render('foo/bar', format => 'html');
              $self->render('foo/bar', {format => 'html'});
          For renderers the stash will no longer get an updated template,
          instead a new argument will be passed along.
              {template => 'foo/bar', format => 'html', handler => 'epl'}
        - Simplified context and controller in Mojolicious, this change is
          not backwards compatible!
          If you've been using a custom context object you'll now have to use
          a custom controller base class.
          The new controller_class attribute can now be used to set the
          default controller in Mojolicious.
          There is also no $c argument anymore actions get called with, since
          everything is in $self now.
        - Refactored and renamed Mojo::Transaction and Mojo::Pipeline, this
          change is not backwards compatible!
              Mojo::Transaction -> Mojo::Transaction::Single
              Mojo::Pipeline -> Mojo::Transaction::Pipeline
        - Refactored and renamed Mojo::File and Mojo::File::Memory, this
          change is not backwards compatible!
              Mojo::File -> Mojo::Asset::File
              Mojo::File::Memory -> Mojo::Asset::Memory
        - Refactored and renamed Mojo::Content, this change is not backwards
          compatible!

        - Cleaned up the whole script system, this change is mostly backwards

        - Changed routes syntax again, this change is not entirely backwards
          compatible but will only affect you if you are using the relaxed
